# Phoenix Point Vortex Extension

This repository houses a basic extension for the [Vortex mod manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) which allows for management of mods via Vortex.

## What does this extension do?

* Allow for management of Phoenix Point mods within Vortex.
* Ensures the existence of the `Mods` folder which all current mod loaders adhere to.

## What **doesn't** this extension do?

* Install PPML or Modnix. It is assumed you already have one of these installed.

## To-Do

- [ ] Automated install of supported mod loaders. (Modnix, PPML)
- [ ] Get approved by Nexus as a proper game extension. (Enables direct installs from the nexus mods website.)
